# Experiments-with-GRL-and-Small-Molecule-Property-Prediction

A small personal repo for tinkering with Graph Representation Learning (GRL) on small molecules, primarily in a Jupyter Notebook setup initially.

Data is primarily sourced from the Therapeutics Data Commons (TDC): https://tdcommons.ai/

Shoutout to the Oxford Protein Informatics Group (OPIG) for a lot of helpful blogs that have enabled me to get started with a lot of the key packages and tools: https://www.blopig.com/blog/
