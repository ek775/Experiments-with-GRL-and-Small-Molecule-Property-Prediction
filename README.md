# Experiments-with-GRL-and-Small-Molecule-Property-Prediction

A small personal repo for tinkering with Graph Representation Learning (GRL), Network Analysis, and Molecular Property Prediction (ADMET)

Data is primarily sourced from the Therapeutics Data Commons (TDC): https://tdcommons.ai/

Anaconda Environment Information can be found in the documentation folder in a .yml file.

Shoutout to the Oxford Protein Informatics Group (OPIG) for a lot of helpful blogs that have enabled me to get started with a lot of the key packages and tools: https://www.blopig.com/blog/
